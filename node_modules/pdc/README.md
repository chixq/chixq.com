# pdc

a pandoc wrapper for node.js

## Installation

```
npm install pdc
```

This package requires [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to be
installed and to be in `PATH`.

## Usage

```js
var pandoc = require('pdc');

pandoc('# Heading', 'markdown', 'html', function(err, result) {
  if (err)
    throw err;

  console.log(result);
});
```

This will print:

```html
<h1 id="heading">Heading</h1>
```

## API

```js
pandoc(src, from, to[, options], callback);
```

*   `src` is a string containing the entire source text, that shall be
    converted.
*   `from` is a string containing the type of the source text. (E.g.
    `'markdown'`)
*   `to` is a string containing the type of the destination text. (E.g.
    `'html'`)
*   `options` [optional] is an array with additional command line flags (E.g.
    `[ '-v' ]` for pandocs version).
*   `callback` is a function that is called after parsing. It takes two
    arguments `(err, result)`, where `err` is an error or `null` and `result` is
    a string containing the converted text.

such a great tool -- It adds so many possibilities to Markdown -- and of course
[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) for creating Markdown itself.
